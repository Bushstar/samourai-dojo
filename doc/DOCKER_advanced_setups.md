# MyDojo - Advanced Setups


The configuration files of Dojo provide a few advanced options allowing to tune your setup.

A word of caution, though, the default values of these options try to maximize your privacy at a network level. Most of the advanced setups described in this document may damage your privacy. Use at your own risk!

## External Bitcoin full node ##

By default, Dojo installs and runs a Bitcoin full node in Docker.

The following procedure allows to bypass the installation of this full node by telling Dojo to rely on an external bitcoind running on your host machine.


### Requirements ###

The external full node mustn't be pruned.

The external full node must be configured for the support of Dojo. Edit the bitcoin.conf file of your external full node and check that the following lines are properly initialized.

```
# Force bitcoind to accept JSON-RPC commands
server=1

# Force bitcoind to index all the transactions
txindex=1

# Check that bitcoind accepts connections from 127.0.0.1 (linux)
# or from the IP address of the Docker Virtual Machine (MacOS, Windows)
rpcallowip=... 

# Check that a port is defined for the RPC API (or 8332 will be used as default value)
rpcport=...

# Check that the RPC API listens on an IP address accessible from the nodejs container
rpcbind=...

# Check that the RPC user is set
rpcuser=...

# Check that the RPC password is set
rpcpassword=

# Enable publish hash block on an IP address accessible from the nodejs container
zmqpubhashblock=...

# Enable publish raw transaction on an IP address accessible from the nodejs container
zmqpubrawtx=...
```


### Procedure ###

#### Configuration of Dojo ####

```
# Edit the bitcoin config template file
nano ./conf/docker-bitcoind.conf.tpl

#
# Set the value of SLICED_INSTALL to "off"
# Set the value of SLICED_IP with the IP address of you bitcoin full node
# Set the value of SLICED_RPC_PORT with the port used by your bitcoin full node for the RPC API
# Set the value of SLICED_ZMQ_RAWTXS with the port used by your bitcoin full node for ZMQ notifications of raw transactions
#   (i.e. port defined for -zmqpubrawtx in the bitcoin.conf of your full node)
# Set the value of SLICED_ZMQ_BLK_HASH with the port used by your bitcoin full node for ZMQ notifications of block hashes
#   (i.e. port defined for -zmqpubhashblock in the bitcoin.conf of your full node)
#
# Save and exit nano
#
```

### Fast import of block headers in Dojo (optional) ###

When Dojo is installed for the first time, the Tracker imports the block headers in the database.

Follow these steps if you want to speed up this operation by preloading an archive of the block headers.

```
# Download the archive [https://samouraiwallet.com/static/share/2_blocks.sql.gz](https://samouraiwallet.com/static/share/2_blocks.sql.gz) to the "<dojo_dir>/db-scripts/" directory. Don't modify the name of the archive.
```


#### Start the installation of Dojo ####

```
./dojo.sh install
```

## bitcoind RPC API ans ZMQ notifications exposed to external apps ##

By default, access to the RPC API of your bitcoind is restricted to Docker containers hosted on the "dojonet" network.

The following steps allow to expose the RPC API and ZMQ notifications to applications running on your local machine but outside of Docker.

```
# 
# If your Docker runs on macos or windows,
# retrieve the local IP address of the VM
# hosting your Docker containers
#

# Stop your Dojo
./dojo.sh stop

# Edit the bitcoin config file
nano ./conf/docker-bitcoind.conf

#
# Set the value of SLICED_RPC_EXTERNAL to "on"
#
# If your Docker runs on macos or windows,
# set the value of SLICED_RPC_EXTERNAL_IP to the IP address of the VM
#
# Save and exit nano
#

# Start your Dojo
./dojo.sh start
```

With this setting, external applications running on your local machine should be able to access the following ports:
* 9500: bitcoind zmqpubhashtx notifications
* 9501: bitcoind zmqpubrawtx notifications
* 9502: bitcoind zmqpubhashblock notifications
* 9503: bitcoind zmqpubrawblock notifications
* 28256: bitcoind RPC API

Note: this option has no effect if your setup relies on a external full node (i.e. if SLICED_INSTALL is set to "off").


<a name="static_onion"/>

## Static onion address for bitcoind hidden service ##

By default, Dojo creates a new onion address for your bitcoind at each startup. 

The following steps allow to keep a static onion address (not recommended).

```
# Stop your Dojo
./dojo.sh stop

# Edit the bitcoin config file
nano ./conf/docker-bitcoind.conf

#
# Set the value of SLICED_EPHEMERAL_HS to "off"
#

# Start your Dojo
./dojo.sh start
```

Note: this option has no effect if your setup relies on a external full node (i.e. if SLICED_INSTALL is set to "off").


<a name="testnet"/>

## Support of testnet ##

By default, Dojo is installed for running on Bitcoin mainnet.

The following steps allow to install an instance of Dojo running on Bitcoin testnet.

```
# Edit the common config template file
nano ./conf/docker-common.conf.tpl

#
# Set the value of COMMON_BTC_NETWORK to "testnet"
#
# Save and exit nano
#
```

Note: This option must be set before the first installation of Dojo and mustn't be changed after this first installation.

Known limitation: A single instance of Dojo can be run per machine (a same machine can't host both a mainnet and a testnet instance of Dojo).
